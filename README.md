Autonomic Micro Smart Grid simulator

MisTiGriD is a smart micro-grid simulation platform: an instance of MisTiGriD simulates a smart house with several appliances and their autonomic managers. MisTiGriD intends to provide an interactive and extensible demonstration playground for developpers of autonomic systems.

Have a look at :
  - the mistigrid_instance/ folder to get a runnable instance of MisTiGriD
  - the documentation/ folder for general documentation about the source code
